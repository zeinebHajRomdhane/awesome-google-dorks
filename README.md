## 🎯 Practical Examples & Pro Tips

- **Find PDF files about security**
  - `filetype:pdf security`
- **Find pages linking to Github**
  - `link:fr.github.com`
- **Look for open directory listings**
  - `intitle:"index of /"`
- **Find admin login pages**
  - `allinurl:"admin login"`
- **Search for credential exposures in text files**
  - `intext:password filetype:txt`
- **List admin passwords on French sites**
  - `inurl:password admin site:fr`

### 🧠 Tips for Using Dorks Effectively

- ✨ **Chain operators for specificity:** Combine multiple operators to reduce noise. E.g., `site:.gov filetype:xls intext:email`.
- 🔍 **Focus on exposed directories:** Directory listings (`intitle:"index of /"`) with filetype filters (`filetype:log`, `filetype:bak`) help spot forgotten backups and logs.
- 🕵️ **Identify password leaks:** Use `intext:password | pass | pwd` with `filetype:txt OR filetype:log` to maximize keyword coverage.
- 🌍 **Target regions or languages:** Use `site:fr`, `site:edu`, or `site:gov` to focus on relevant TLDs. Use language-specific words in dorks.
- ⏱️ **Look for recent exposures:** Use `daterange:` for time-limited leaks or recently indexed content.
- 🃏 **Wildcard search:** Use `*` to capture variable parts, e.g., `intitle:"index of" inurl:ftp *backup*`.
- 🏷️ **Hunt for web shells or admin consoles:** `intitle:"shell" OR intitle:"upload" filetype:php -github` to avoid public source repositories.
- 👁️ **Spot exposed documents:** Try `filetype:xls intext:"login" intext:"password"` to find spreadsheets holding access data.

## 🚨 Security Tips & Ethical Use

- **Never scan or probe without explicit authorization.**
- Use `site:` operators to minimize collateral impact and avoid unnecessary attention.
- Prefer using VPNs, Tor, or proxies to separate recon from personal activity.
- Google may temporarily block you for too many similar queries—diversify your dorks and throttle your requests.
- If you discover sensitive data, engage in responsible disclosure to the site owner.
- Log your search queries to document ethical/research use if needed.

## Dork examples in action

> Real-world dorks you can adapt:

- Discover sensitive PDF files about network configurations
  - `filetype:pdf intext:"configuration" intext:"network" site:.gov`
- Find public backup files on any French site:
  - `site:fr inurl:backup filetype:zip OR filetype:tar`
- Detect open admin interfaces with multiple keywords:
  - `allintitle:admin login "dashboard"`
- Search for emails on Brazilian university websites:
  - `site:br intext:@gmail.com OR intext:@yahoo.com`
- Hunt for SQL error messages:
  - `intext:"you have an error in your SQL syntax" -github`
- Find exposed WordPress login panels:
  - `inurl:wp-login.php -github`
- Locate cameras, printers, or embedded devices:
  - `inurl:view/view.shtml`  
  - `inurl:main.cgi admin`

## How to Protect Against Google Dorks

**Google Dorks** refer to advanced search queries that attackers can use to find sensitive or vulnerable information indexed by search engines. To prevent sensitive data or pages from being exposed in search results, you can use the following techniques:

### 1. Exclude Sensitive Pages from Indexing

Add the following META tag in the HTML code of sensitive pages to prevent them from being indexed:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```

### 2. Block Link Following and Indexing

To both block search engines from following links and from indexing the page, use:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```

### 3. Disable Caching and Snippet Creation

To both block search engines from following links and from indexing the page, use:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nosnippet, nocache, noodp, noydir">
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes

These settings only affect compliant search engines (like Google, Bing, etc.). They do not prevent access to the page itself.
