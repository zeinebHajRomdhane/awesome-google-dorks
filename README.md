OSINT workflows using dorks
- Target profiling
  - Start with broad company-level site: searches.
  - Expand to subdomains with site:*.company.com.
  - Use intext: and intitle: to extract public reports, presentations, and org charts.

- Credential discovery
  - Search for "password", "passwd", "credentials" across file types and hosts.
  - Cross-check findings with breach databases and public paste sites.

- Vendor and supply-chain checks
  - Search for references to vendor names inside partner sites.
  - Use site:vendor.com intext:"partner" OR "customer"

- Social engineering reconnaissance
  - Gather public documents with internal contacts and titles.
  - Collect job descriptions and contact patterns from job boards and PDFs.
  - Use information to plan scoped social tests.

Penetration testing workflows
- Recon phase
  - Use dorks to find entry points: admin, upload, panels.
  - Map exposed file types and accessible directories.

- Enumeration and validation
  - Use found URLs to probe for known software, versions, and misconfigurations.
  - Test only within agreed scope.

- Exploitation preparation
  - Build hardening checklist of discovered items: exposed backups, open panels, default credentials.
  - Create tickets for responsible disclosure or remediation.

- Reporting
  - Document each dork with the date, query, and links.
  - Include reproduction steps and suggested mitigations.

Parsing, filtering, and automation
- Export results manually into a CSV or spreadsheet.
  - Use copy/paste from the browser results.
  - Record title, URL, snippet, and date.

- Automate with Google Custom Search JSON API
  - Use the Custom Search API to run queries programmatically.
  - Respect query limits and API terms.

- Use headless browsers for richer scraping
  - Puppeteer or Playwright can fetch dynamic pages and yield richer content.
  - Avoid scraping Google SERPs at scale without proper credentials.

- Filter noise with additional operators
  - Exclude known noisy hosts: -site:facebook.com -site:twitter.com
  - Narrow to file types and exact phrases.

- Sample parsing pipeline (conceptual)
  - 1) Run query or API call.
  - 2) Normalize URLs.
  - 3) Filter by HTTP status (200).
  - 4) Fetch page and extract patterns (emails, keys).
  - 5) Store results in a database and label by severity.

Integrations with security tools
- Burp Suite
  - Use dork results to seed Burp Intruder or Scanner.
  - Crawl the target pages from the "Target" tab.

- Nmap and masscan
  - Use discovered hostnames to map open ports and services.
  - Combine DNS enumeration with dork results.

- Shodan
  - Cross-reference dork-discovered hosts with Shodan to find open ports and services.

- Amass, Subfinder
  - Use domains returned by dorks to expand subdomain lists.
  - Feed results into automated reconnaissance pipelines.

- GitHub and code search
  - Use dorks to find leaked code on GitHub using site:github.com and filetype: keywords.
  - Combine with GitHub code search to validate source leaks.

Crafting safe, scoped dorks
- Always restrict to an authorized scope.
  - Use site:company.com OR domain filters to prevent off-scope discovery.

- Combine negative filters to reduce noise.
  - -site:*.cdnprovider.net -site:aws.amazon.com

- Use precise phrases and file types to reduce false positives.
  - "DB_PASSWORD" filetype:env

- Favor manual review for high-risk hits.
  - Inspect any credential or secret before attempting to use it.

Building a private dork library
- Structure
  - /dorks
    - /files
    - /credentials
    - /admin-panels
    - /cloud
    - /iot
  - Each file contains labeled queries and short notes.

- Metadata per dork
  - Title
  - Query
  - Category
  - Risk level
  - False positive notes
  - Date tested

- Versioning
  - Keep the library in Git.
  - Tag releases with curated sets and sample scripts.

- Sharing and reuse
  - Use GitHub Releases (link above) for downloadable cheat-sheets and CSV exports: https://github.com/zeinebHajRomdhane/awesome-google-dorks/releases

High-value dorks ‚Äî details and tuning tips
- Backup and DB dumps
  - Query:
    - filetype:sql "INSERT INTO" "users"
  - Tuning:
    - Add site: to focus on a domain.
    - Narrow by date ranges in Google Tools.

- Private keys and credentials
  - Query:
    - filetype:pem OR filetype:key "BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY"
  - Tuning:
    - Exclude public code hosts to reduce noise: -site:github.com

- Web application debug traces
  - Query:
    - intitle:"Application error" OR intext:"Stack trace"
  - Tuning:
    - Add known framework markers: intext:"Zend" OR intext:"Django"

- Admin console and panels
  - Query:
    - inurl:admin OR inurl:dashboard intitle:"login"
  - Tuning:
    - Combine with server fingerprinting to guess software.

- Exposed cameras and DVRs
  - Query:
    - inurl:/view/view.shtml OR intitle:"Live View" "camera"
  - Tuning:
    - Use country codes or ISP blocks to narrow geography.

- Cloud configuration leaks
  - Query:
    - site:amazonaws.com "credentials" OR "secret"
  - Tuning:
    - Add filetype:json to narrow bucket manifests or tools outputs.

Advanced operator patterns and recipes
- Combine site scope with filetype and phrase
  - site:target.com filetype:pdf "confidential"

- Use OR to broaden but control with parentheses
  - (inurl:admin OR inurl:dashboard) site:target.com

- Chain negative filters
  - filetype:log -site:github.com -site:pastebin.com

- Use exact phrase matching for secrets
  - intext:"PRIVATE_KEY" filetype:txt

- Use Google cached: to access a historical copy
  - cache:target.com/page

Query tuning to reduce noise
- Remove popular hosts and CDNs:
  - -site:github.com -site:cdn.cloudflare.net -site:googleusercontent.com

- Limit to specific inurl patterns:
  - allinurl: /backup db backup

- Exclude test and dev environments:
  - -inurl:staging -inurl:dev -inurl:test

Tools and scripts (conceptual)
- dork-runner.sh (bash)
  - Accepts a list of dorks.
  - Queries Google Custom Search API.
  - Saves JSON results to a file.
  - Example flow (pseudocode):
    - for query in dork_list; do call_api(query) >> results.json; done

- dork-parse.py (python)
  - Reads results JSON.
  - Extracts URLs and snippets.
  - Filters by regex patterns for keys, emails, and phone numbers.
  - Stores outputs to SQLite.

- dork-scan.yaml (config for scan manager)
  - A list of query categories and scanning options.
  - Used by internal tools to prioritize targets.

Regex and patterns to extract secrets
- Emails: [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}
- AWS Access Key ID: AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}
- AWS Secret Access Key: (?i)[A-Za-z0-9/+=]{40}
- Generic API keys: [A-Za-z0-9_\-]{20,}

Example automated parsing (conceptual)
- Run dork via API -> get JSON -> extract URLs -> fetch page -> run regex -> tag hits -> save to DB.

Search engine alternatives and complements
- Bing advanced operators have different syntax but similar power.
- DuckDuckGo and Startpage offer privacy-focused alternatives.
- Shodan and Censys index device-level metadata, useful for IoT and exposed services.

Common pitfalls and false positives
- Public code forks and mirrors often show up for sensitive dorks.
- Large CDNs may host many files that match filetype filters.
- Old backup files may return stale data with no access risk.
- Dorks may return results blocked by robots.txt or authentication.

Safe handling of sensitive findings
- Record exact query and URL.
- Do not attempt to use credentials.
- Report through authorized channels or a defined disclosure program.
- Remove local copies of sensitive files from public places.
